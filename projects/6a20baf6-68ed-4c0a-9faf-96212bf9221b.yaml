concept: Chained Hulling Algorithm for Convex Hull Area of Canvas Alpha Threshold
stage: 2
remarks: >-
  There are some improvements I'd like to make to this algorithm, like developing a histogram of perimiters at different alpha levels instead of just 1 binary hull around a threshold alpha value at a time.
