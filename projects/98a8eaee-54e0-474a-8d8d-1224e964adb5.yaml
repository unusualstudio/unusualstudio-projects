  I have the idea of what I'd want to fill in with this, but not necessarily
  the skill or knowledge to implement it.

  The main reason I originally set up this project was to provide an
  alternative to prevent the gauche, inorganic CommonMark specification from
  catching on; in the time since that project originally launched, this hasn't
  really given any indication of becoming that much of a threat, so I've pretty
  much let this project fall by the wayside.
