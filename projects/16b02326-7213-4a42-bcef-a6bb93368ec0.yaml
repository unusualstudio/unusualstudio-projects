  I'm not sure if this is currently working; my existing implementation would
  need a significant overhaul.

  These days, there are a bunch of better-maintained sites that work basically
  the same way as this was going to work, so without some really fresh ideas
  that aren't currently being explored, there isn't really anything to add to
  this.
